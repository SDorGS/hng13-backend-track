# HNG 13 Backend Track Repository

This repository is my digital memory, preserving the progress of my journey through the **HNG 13 Backend Track** tasks. It serves both as a space for collaboration and as a manifestation of processâ€”recording not just what I built, but how my understanding evolved as I built it. In essence, it is a self-documenting mirror of my mind during the HNG 13 Backend Track.

The **HNG Internship** is a large-scale, fast-paced, remote technology bootcamp designed to simulate real-world professional experience under time pressure and collaboration, ultimately shaping interns into production-ready developers.

Within this ecosystem, the **Backend Track** focuses on the server-side logic of applications. It is both a training ground for backend architecture, API design, and systems reasoning, and a social micro-ecosystem where interns collaborate, debug, and deploy real APIs under the mentorship of experienced engineers.
